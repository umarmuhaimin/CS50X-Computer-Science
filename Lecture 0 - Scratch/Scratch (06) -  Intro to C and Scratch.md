🧭 What’s Ahead

1) Plan for This Week and Next
 - You will be learning this week about Scratch, a visual programming language.
 - Then, in future weeks, you will learn about C. That will look something like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

 - By learning C, you will be far more prepared for future learning in other programming languages like Python.
 - Notice how programmers have used abstraction to build off the work of other programmers. Rather than programming in ones and zeroes, programming languages were created to abstract away from the incredibly challenging task of programming in binary to more and more easy-to-use programming languages. We can stand on the shoulders of others!

2) What Scratch Is
 - Scratch is a visual programming language developed by MIT.
 - Scratch utilizes the same essential coding building blocks that we covered earlier in this lecture.
 - Scratch is a great way to get into computer programming because it allows you to play with these building blocks in a visual manner, not having to be concerned about the syntax of curly braces, semicolons, parentheses, and the like.

3) Scratch IDE (described layout)
 - Left panel: palette of draggable blocks (your instructions).
 - Middle/right panel: scripting area where you drop and arrange blocks to form a program.
 - Far right: stage where the cat sprite appears; this is where your program “runs” visually.

4) Coordinates
 - Scratch operates on a coordinate system. Notice that the center of the stage is at coordinate (0,0). Right now, the cat’s position is at that same position.
