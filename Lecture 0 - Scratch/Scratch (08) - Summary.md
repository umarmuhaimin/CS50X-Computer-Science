🧾 Scratch (08) - Summary

1) Big picture
- Positioned CS50x in the broader CS world; Scratch as a gentle on-ramp.
- AI can speed you up, but fundamentals let you use AI well and responsibly.

2) Key takeaways
- Problem-solving is core to CS: inputs → algorithm (black box) → outputs.
- Data representations: numbers (binary), text (ASCII/Unicode), images (RGB), audio/video (bytes over time).
- Pseudocoding: plan logic in plain language before coding.
- Abstraction: break problems into smaller tasks; reuse blocks/functions.
- Building blocks: functions, conditionals, loops, variables.
- Scratch projects: say/ask, speak, loops, custom blocks, input validation, conditionals.

3) Tools & practices
- IDE layout: blocks palette → scripting area → stage; coordinate system with (0,0) center.
- Use loops to avoid repetition; use custom blocks for reuse and clarity.
- Validate inputs (e.g., keep asking until valid) even in Scratch workflows.

4) AI usage guidance
- Reasonable: brainstorming, clarifying instructions, debugging hints.
- Unreasonable: submitting AI-produced work as your own, bypassing learning.

5) Next steps
- Apply the same logic skills as we transition to C.
- Keep practicing decomposition (abstraction) and pseudocode before building.
- Build a small Scratch project that uses conditionals, loops, and a custom block.
