🔤 Unicode

1) Overview
 - As time has rolled on, there are more and more ways to communicate via text.
 - Since there were not enough digits in binary to represent all the various characters that could be represented by humans, the Unicode standard expanded the number of bits that can be transmitted and understood by computers. Unicode includes not only special characters, but emoji as well.

2) Emoji Examples 😀
 - There are emoji that you probably use every day. The following may look familiar to you:

😀 😃 😄 😁 😆 😅 😂 🙂 🙃 😉 😊 😇 😍 😘 😗 😙 😚 😋 😛 😜 😝 🤑 🤓 😎 🤗 😏 😶 😐 😑 😒 🙄 😬 😕 ☹️ 😟 😮 😯 😲 😳 😦 😧 😨

3) Notes
 - While the pattern of zeros and ones is standardized within Unicode, each device manufacturer may display each emoji slightly differently than another manufacturer.
 - More and more features are being added to the Unicode standard to represent further characters and emoji.

🎨 RGB

4) Basics
 - Zeros and ones can be used to represent color.
 - Red, green, and blue (called RGB) are a combination of three numbers.

5) Example Values → Blocks

```
🟥 72   🟩 73   🟦 33
```

6) Interpreting 72, 73, 33
 - Taking our previously used 72, 73, and 33, which said HI! via text, would be interpreted by image readers as a light shade of yellow. The red value would be 72, the green value would be 73, and the blue would be 33.

Resulting swatch (approx.):

```
🟨 72,73,33
```

7) Pixels and Media
 - The three bytes required to represent various colors of red, blue, and green (or RGB) make up each pixel (or dot) of color in any digital image. Images are simply collections of RGB values.
 - Zeros and ones can be used to represent images, videos, and music!
 - Videos are sequences of many images that are stored together, just like a flipbook.
 - Music can be represented similarly using various combinations of bytes.
