🐧 C (03) - Linux / CLI essentials

1) Why CLI
 - We use the CLI to make and run programs; it’s often more efficient than the GUI for commands and file work.

2) Common commands
 - `cd`  change directory
 - `cp`  copy files/directories
 - `ls`  list files
 - `mkdir` create directory
 - `mv`  move/rename files/directories
 - `rm`  remove files
 - `rmdir` remove empty directories

3) Try it
 - Run `ls` in the terminal to list files in the current folder.
